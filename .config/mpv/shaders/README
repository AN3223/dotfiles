The nlmeans shaders are denoisers and/or adaptive sharpeners. They have 
documentation embedded in them, with each nlmeans profile having a profile 
description near the top. 

The guided shaders are experimental denoisers. guided_rf is currently broken.

I unwisely placed these shaders in my dotfiles repository, not anticipating 
ever having more than just one shader here. They are here to stay though, since 
I do not want to break links/clones. I recommend cloning with --depth 1 to save 
space/bandwidth/time.

Despite the fact that this is a dotfiles repository, please feel free to open 
issues and send pull requests, big or small!
