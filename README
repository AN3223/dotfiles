My dotfiles are tightly intertwined with my scripts, you can find my scripts
here: https://github.com/an3223/scripts/

Some scripts live here (e.g., .config/mpv/scripts/) and many config files live
here. Please don't blindly copy my config files onto your system. They are
written for me and they probably don't behave the way you want. Use them as
guidance instead.

Contributions are welcome.
