You can clone this repository as a hidden service if you so desire:
torsocks git clone --depth 1 git://r7imjx7zhchprlklefxtunh2yfxt545yed64gwvuqlln4kmeswct3vad.onion/dotfiles

This is my set of configuration files that I use on my systems. Most have been
written by me and I try to keep them tidy. You are free to do whatever you wish
with these. However I recommend you do not copy them blindly, you may end up
with unexpected behavior.

My dotfiles are tightly intertwined with my scripts, you can find my scripts
here: https://github.com/an3223/scripts/

Contributions are welcome.
